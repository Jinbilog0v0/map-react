It is located on the island of Luzon and spreads along the eastern shore of Manila Bay at the mouth of the Pasig River. The city’s name, originally Maynilad, is derived from that of the nilad plant, a flowering shrub adapted to marshy conditions, which once grew profusely along the banks of the river; the name was shortened first to Maynila and then to its present form. In 1975, by presidential decree, Manila and its contiguous cities and municipalities were integrated to function as a single administrative region, known as Metropolitan Manila (also called the National Capital Region); the Manila city proper encompasses only a small proportion of that area.",

Considered part of Metropolitan Manila, the city began to grow after World War II (1939–45) with the construction of government buildings on Capitol Site. Many functions of national government remained in Manila, however, and the seat of government moved back to Manila in 1976."

After the United States occupied the Philippines in 1898, Governor William Howard Taft and other officials proposed the pleasant site nestled in pine-clad hills at about 4,900 feet (1,500 metres) to serve as the summer capital of the Philippines. The idea was adopted by the Filipinos, and Baguio became the country’s foremost resort, with numerous hotels, cottages, and summer homes and with excellent air, road, and rail connections to Manila, 160 miles (260 km) south. In 1976, however, Baguio ceased to be the official summer capital, Manila serving from that date as the capital throughout the year. Baguio is an important gold-mining centre, and copper is extracted at nearby Mankayan."
